            This is my first run at making a webpage using flexbox. Well, this
            is actually my second run, the first one was over done and I didnt
            like it , so , I want to give it another try and to not go over
            board. Sometimes keeping it simple is the best idea.

              I am orignally from Salinas, Ca.I move to San Francisco 2 years
              ago in search of a career. I was working in the feilds and some
              other labor work, but the hopes of being able to provide more for
              my kids and to have a bright future pushed me to leave home in
              search of education success. I am a born again christain and got
              quite a testimony to tell but i will leave that for another time.

              I love reggae music and christian music. I enjoy learning about
              forbidden history and and love to read star wars books. Rick and
              Morty and Attack on Titan are my guilty pleasures.

              This is my favorite project I worked on. Yes, it is only a email
              contact form but, I like it because it is simple and looks alot
              better than things I havd done in the past, I'll tell you that
              much. Now that I think about it maybe i should include some of my
              old work, so people could see the progress I have made.

              This project is called the Decoder Ring, and it is an application
              that allows the user to code and to decode messages. There is
              three different ways the Decoder Ring can work. The Ceasar Cypher,
              The Polybius Square, and The Substitution Cypher.Each method will
              code or decode the user's inputted message in a different way. The
              project was very challenging. Honestly, if my Macbook Air screen
              was any cheaper, I would not be working on this project right now.
